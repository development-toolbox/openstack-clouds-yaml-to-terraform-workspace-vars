  feat(init): add OpenStack to Terraform Cloud workspace variable toolbox

This commit initializes the project as a toolbox for automating the transfer of OpenStack
cloud authentication details from clouds.yaml into Terraform Cloud workspace environment
variables.

### Added:
- `upload_openstack_vars.py`: A script that extracts authentication details from OpenStack’s
  clouds.yaml and securely uploads them as environment variables to Terraform Cloud.
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation explaining setup, usage, and integration with
  CI/CD pipelines.
- `.gitignore`: Ignores Python cache files and local environment configurations.

### Features:
- Extracts OpenStack credentials dynamically from clouds.yaml
- Ensures `region_name` exists before proceeding
- Automatically retrieves Terraform Cloud workspace ID
- Marks `OS_PASSWORD` as sensitive for security
- Provides detailed error handling and API response logging
- Supports integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated credential management

This marks the foundation of the toolbox, which can be extended with additional automation
features in the future.
